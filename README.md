<h1 align=center>🎯 Dart Introduction</h1> 

<p align=justify> This repository contains a collection of simple, well-commented code examples that demonstrate the <b>fundamental concepts of the Dart programming language</b>.  
Each file is written with clarity and detailed explanations to make it easy for beginners to understand how Dart works in practice, from basic syntax and variable declarations to simple data manipulation and console output.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning companion and quick reference while studying Dart.  
All examples are based on concepts and lessons covered in <b>Fernando Herrera’s Dart course</b>, which provides a structured and practical introduction to the language.  
By rewriting and experimenting with each topic, I aim to strengthen my understanding of Dart’s syntax, features, and core principles, preparing for more advanced topics like Flutter and backend development with Dart.

<h2 align=center> 📘 About</h2>

<p align=justify> Each file in this repository demonstrates a specific Dart concept through simple, clear, and fully commented code. The goal is not only to show how Dart works, but also to make every example easy to read and understand, even for those who are just beginning to learn programming.  

All the examples are written step by step, with detailed comments explaining what each line of code does and why it is used. This approach turns the repository into both a learning resource and a quick reference for reviewing Dart’s syntax and core programming logic.  

Every example emphasizes clean and readable code while providing clear explanations of Dart’s key features, such as variables, data types, functions, and control structures. The focus is on understanding the reasoning behind each concept rather than just memorizing syntax.  

Whether you are following Fernando Herrera’s Dart course or learning independently, this repository aims to serve as a solid foundation for grasping the essentials of Dart before moving on to more advanced topics like Flutter development.
